                    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. Itâ€™s
                    primarily used for client-side scripting on the web, enabling interactive web pages, animations, and dynamic user
                    experiences. JavaScript is executed on the client-side (web browser) or server-side (Node.js, AWS Lambda, etc.) and is
                    essential for web development.

                    Java and JavaScript have distinct purposes, strengths, and limitations. These factors can influence the types of
                    projects you can create and the careers you pursue. Some tech professionals learn both Java and JavaScript, but they may
                    be optional, depending on your professional goals.

                    No, it is not necessary to know Java before learning JavaScript. JavaScript and Java are two separate programming
                    languages with different syntax, purpose, and execution environments. While there are some similarities between the two,
                    such as both being object-oriented languages, they are distinct and can be learned independently.

                    JavaScript and ECMAScript are closely related but distinct concepts. ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages,
                    including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript, published by Ecma International. It defines the syntax and semantics of
                    the core language, including features such as functions, variables, data types,
